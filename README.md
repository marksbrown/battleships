# Battleships!
## A Lockdown 2020 Special!

An implementation of Battleships using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)

# Day One
A video of random vs random : https://github.com/marksbrown/battleships/blob/master/day_one.mp4

Much of the guts of the game are present.
Next to be done will be :

1. Players ability to place their own ships
2. Actual game logic (real-time versus turn-based)
3. Interaction between shots and ships
